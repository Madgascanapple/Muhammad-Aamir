            <h2>Hello there! I'm Muhammad Aamir</h2>
</html>
</html>
            <p>I'm a teen web developer from Pakistan with over one year of practical experience in building responsive, interactive, and modern web applications. What began as a general interest in technology quickly turned into a passion for designing and developing things for the web.<br><br>

                Since then, I’ve dedicated countless hours to learning the core building blocks of the web — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and have gone on to work with more advanced tools like React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap. These technologies have allowed me to create fast, accessible, and beautifully designed interfaces that work seamlessly across different devices.<br><br>
                
                Over the past year, I’ve built a wide range of personal projects. From clean, single-page portfolios to more complex interactive apps, each project has taught me something new — whether it’s improving performance, writing cleaner code, or designing for real users. I take pride in creating experiences that are not only functional but also thoughtfully designed.<br><br>
                
                What makes me excited about this field is that there’s always something new to learn. Right now, I’m focused on growing beyond frontend development. I’ve started exploring backend technologies, databases, and APIs to become a complete full-stack developer. Eventually, I want to build not just websites and applications, but developer tools, libraries, or even my own frameworks that others can use to build faster and smarter.<br><br>
                
                As someone who believes in learning by doing, I regularly experiment with new ideas, share my progress, and reflect on what I learn. I also love connecting with other developers, whether it's to collaborate on projects, get feedback, or just talk tech.<br><br>
                
                This website is where I showcase my work, share what I'm building, and document my growth as a developer. Thank you for visiting — and feel free to explore my projects, reach out, or follow along as I continue learning and creating.<br><br>
